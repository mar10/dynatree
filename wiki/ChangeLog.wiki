See the [http://code.google.com/p/dynatree/issues/list?can=1&q=milestone:Release0.3+status%3AFixed%2CVerified&sort=-modified&colspec=ID%20Type%20Status%20Priority%20Milestone%20Owner%20Summary Issue List] for this release.

===== Updating from a previous release =====
This is the first jQuery based release, so there is no update path.

==== 0.2 and before ====
Dynatree is based on [http://wwWendt.de/tech/lazytree lazytree 0.2].
I had to rename it, because there already was a jQuery plugin named _lazytree_.
